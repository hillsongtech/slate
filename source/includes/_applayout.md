## App Layout

```json
{
  "sideMenu": {
  	"hasSideMenu": true,
  	"theme": {},
  	"title": "There Is More",
  },
  "pages": [
  		{
  			"id": 0,
  			"title": "Hello World",
  			"isInNavigation": true
  		}
  ]
}
```

This endpoint retrieves all of the app layout information.
Navigation is seen as the top most layer of the app. 
So we need this information before we can display anything.
